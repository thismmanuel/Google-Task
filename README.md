# Google-Task
 google replicate task on Zuri
Using a tutorial on Zuri Team Youtube Page
I was able to replicate the Google Home Page

WHAT I LEARNT
I understood how padding feature works
I learnt a new tag - <input> - which is a self closing tag
I had a chance to use the <button></button> tag
Grouping sections of the webpage: made it really easier to style
Targeting particular element tags e.g 'footer div a'


WHAT WAS DIFFICULT
Positioning the contents in their right place
Styling the webpage, especially centering and evening out parts of the webpage
Knowing when to use classes, ids and element tags
I had some space at the bottom of my page and i did't know why it was there since I did everything just like in the class. I had to increase the margin of the <main> which caused the footer shift downwards and occupy the space at the bottom



WHAT'S LEFT
Style fonts to match the original Google Home Page
Add the search and mic icons in the input bar
My Profile Thumbnail is also too large. I need to edit and style it to match
